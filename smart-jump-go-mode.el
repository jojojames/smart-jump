;;; Register `go-mode' for `smart-jump'.
;;; This requires the `go-guru' package and the tool `guru' installed and
;;; available on your $PATH.

;;; Code:
(require 'smart-jump)
(require 'go-guru nil t)

(defun smart-jump-go-mode-register ()
  "Register `go-mode' for `smart-jump'."
  (smart-jump-register :modes 'go-mode
                       :jump-fn 'go-guru-definition
                       :refs-fn 'go-guru-referrers))

(provide 'smart-jump-go-mode)
